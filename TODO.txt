There is a strange behaviour - in normal mode, the automatic images disappear almost straight away, when they shouldn't.
In demo mode, this doesn't happen, which is good. Ideally, we'd have the same behaviour in both cases.

We seem to have lost the shortcut where we can Ctrl-C the top left element - this might be because it has class 'grouped-on focus' rather than just 'focus'
 which was the case before
